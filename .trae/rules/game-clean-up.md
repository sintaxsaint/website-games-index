if the game has a back button that would make the page go back to the main index page or somthing out of its folder remove it e.g     <a href="../index.html" class="back-btn">← Back</a>
    <div class='webgl-content wrap'>
        <div id='gameContainer' style='width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;'></div>
could break another persons website so we remove it
always change the title of the game to be the name of the game and not include a website name in the title e.g <title>Quizcool — Slope</title> becomes <title>Slope</title>
