when integrating any game/app remember to add it to the games list with it id to call it at the end of the url like this Test Game : ID to call: 1
when integrating any game/app put it in its own folder in the games folder
when integrating any game/app add it to the games list in the index.html file also add its call id to the end of the url like this Test Game : ID to call: 1
when integrating any game/app update the call.html script to support it
the id is always a string of numbers the first game will be the number 1 the second game the number 2 and so on
this website will be run on github pages
dont put the rules of the project anywhere in the website or repo like the readme file
please remember to say that i am a solo dev helped by some A.I. so updates take time
DO ALL OF THE GAMES/APPS IN THE TO INTERGRATE FOLDER WHEN INTERGRATING THEM
